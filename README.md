This project is developed with simple ```html```,```css```,```js``` to help people to view algorithmic processes intuitively and entertainingly.

>```Algorithm Visualizer``` is an interactive way and platform that visualize the algorithms in four main domain i.e. Trie data structure, Binary Search Tree, Path Finding and Sort Visual algorithm. The project focuses on visualizng üìä the algorithm and try to make easier to understand and learn the algorithm.

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## ‚ú® Features :
- Step-by-step animation of the algorithm
- Ability to pause animation
- a short information on each algorithms and data structures

## üë®‚Äçüíª How to Use :
- Select the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.
- Enter the input for the algorithm in the text field (for trie and binary search tree, you can use a list of words)
- Press the "Visualize" button to see the animation of the algorithm in action.
- Press the "Pause" button to pause the animation
- Now go and play with it-k

## ‚è≥ Future Improvements :

- [ ] Add more and more algorithms and data structures 
- [ ] Bring a lot of animations to help users visualize things more perfectly
- [ ] Adding the time complexity chart and some small info on each topics


## ENJOY THE BEAUTY OF ALGORITHMS!
